# P.cinnamomi_Genome_Assembly_and_Annotation
This repository is dedicated to all computational analysis used the assembly and annotation of Phytophthora cinnamomi genomes produced as part of thesis project for my PhD in Biology. Predicition and analysis of effector protiens is also included as they largely determine the pathogenicity of such a destructive phytopathogen.
