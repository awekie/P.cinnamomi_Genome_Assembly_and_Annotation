#Structural annotation of masked WGS fasta files was done with BRAKER3 with protein and RNAseq data.
#Protein data was sourced from OrthoDB using the Stramenopiles.fa.gz md5sum: eab4b468d1fcc91c8477d04c797e37aa dataset
#RNA Illumina sequencing data produced by Engelbercht et al. 2021 SRA accession number:SAMN16706908

#Functional annotation of the effectome was done with SignalP v6 and EffectorP v3.
#CDS fasta files were run on the slow-sequential mode of SignalP with with 'eukaryaâ€™ organism parameter.
#Signal-peptide containing proteins were further filtered by EffectorP and blasted against the 'nr' database.

#Blastp output table files in format '6' were imported into Rstudio for filtering
