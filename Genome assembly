#Denovo genome assembly was done with Flye v2.9 with the -nano-hq parameter

#Reference guided genome assembly was achieved with RagTag v2.1 using both the 'correct' and 'scaffold' module
#Phytophthora cinnamomi GKB4 genome published by Engelbrecht et al. 2021 used as reference, WGS file from Genbank JAFJYM000000000
#Scaffolding results in hard masking - with capital N's throughout new fasta assembly file

#To prepare assembly fasta files for repeative element masking, all headers were edited to replace "+" and "|" characters with ":" and "_" respectively.
cat old.fasta | sed 's/\+/:/g' > new.fasta
cat new.fasta | sed 's/|/_/g' > newer.fasta

#Transposable element identification was done with REPET v3 following the TEdenovo and TEannot pipelines, omitting step 6 of the latter.
#Bedtools and all transpoable element annotations from REPET were used with to soft mask the genome assembly fasta files with lower case n's.
bedtools maskfasta -bed [GFF file from REPET] -fi [newer.fasta] -fo [assembly_softmasked.fa]
